Summary: Thanks to all you helpful people.

First, a big thanks to Google for providing my project funding! This would not 
be possible without their financial support.

I expect this page to get longer as the summer goes on. Here is a list of 
individuals in mostly temporal order I'd like to thank for their involvement 
with my project.

+ **Asheesh Laroia**: project mentor
+ **Reid Holmes**: academic advisor for CS 499R
+ **Terri Oda** and **Florian Fuchs**: Python Software Foundation GSoC admins
+ **Shauna Gordon-McKeon**: current OpenHatch overlord, user requirements, 
backup mentor
