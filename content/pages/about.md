Summary: An introductory post to my Google Summer of Code Blog.

Welcome to my blog for my Google Summer of Code 2014 project, coordinated with 
the University of Waterloo for credit towards my undergraduate degree as the 
topics course **CS 499R: FOSS Contributions**. Here I'll provide a quick 
[introduction](#Introduction) to my project as well as relevant [links](#Links).

# <a name="Introduction"></a> Introduction #

The scope of this project is to provide a tool to event organizers that will 
allow them to more easily assemble a "hot list" of bugs for a particular event.

## Why OpenHatch? ##

OpenHatch is a project dedicated to introducing newbies to open source software 
and culture. We achieve this through outreach, events, and our website, a large 
source of aggregated bugs from projects across the web.

Right now, the process for creating a set of bugs to share at an event involves 
a spreadsheet and some laborious searching of our database. We might share 
issues with event attendees using a Google Doc or MoPad. But this process is 
labor-intensive, does not scale, and is not user-friendly. If OpenHatch could 
streamline this process, perhaps we could offer this more accessible tool to 
anyone that wants to organize a sprint.

## Why me? ##

I joined the OpenHatch community after meeting Asheesh Laroia and Carol Willing 
at a conference and getting reprioritized to contribute with them (and not 
WordPress, sorry WordPress) during the open source day. 

I have been an on-and-off contributor since then, giving a small introductory 
presentation to open source at a hackathon using the Open Source Comes to 
Campus slides, stuffing envelopes on vacation in San Francisco, etc. School was 
conflicting with my ability to contribute to the project, so the obvious 
solution was "why not make OpenHatch into school?" A couple of topics course 
proposal forms later and here we are. This was [one of 
three](https://openhatch.org/wiki/GSoC_2014) projects I might have chosen to 
work on this summer.
