Summary: A week at Open Source Bridge and struggles with CSS.

The past three weeks have been centered around conference activities and 
struggles with front-end development. The contrast leaves a wide gap: the 
biggest highlight of the summer thus far was definitely attending Open Source 
Bridge, while the lowest of the lows has been fighting with CSS in the hopes it 
might make things pretty.

# Open Source Bridge #

Attending OSBridge has been one of the best conference experiences I've ever 
had. It's also one of the most unique conference experiences I've ever had. I 
have heard that the conference draws from a philosophy described as "radical 
inclusivity", and having experienced it now myself it is absolutely something I 
can get behind:

+ All food served was vegan, unless specified otherwise (then it was "just" 
vegetarian)
+ Lanes for the flow of movement and strong mobility accommodation were provided
+ All bathrooms had gender-inclusive labeling
+ I was never the only woman in the room (except while staying at my overnight 
accommodations)
+ A great balance was struck between "hard" technical content, business and 
open source culture, and social issues/community problems

Some of the most fun I had was meeting up with other OpenHatchers, some for the 
first time. We went out for a lovely dinner and had a great time working 
together in person, for a change! The people were the highlight of the 
conference, and as most likely the youngest conference attendee, I had a little 
bit of difficulty getting over some squee-minor celebrity moments. Julie told 
us on the first day (at 9AM, even) to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNOZYPZQfV4" title="but not literally">kill our heroes</a>
so I tried to take that to heart. But on the other hand, FIREBEES STICKERS?!

Though videos have not yet posted, where applicable, here were some of my 
favorite talks and sessions:

+ <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1406" title="...and this has nothing to do with Terri being a PSF org admin, I swear">When Many Eyes Fail You: Tales from Security Standards and Open Source</a> by Terri Oda
+ The Women in Open Source BoF
+ [A Crash Course in Tech Management](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1229) by VM Brasseur

And I'd also like to bring attention to Shauna and Britta's talks, since the 
other OpenHatchers deserve a spotlight on my blog:

+ [Civilizing IRC and forums: moderation strategies for mutual respect](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1290) by Britta Gustafson
+ [Deconstructing Open Source Contributions](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1313) by Shauna Gordon-McKeon

I even gave a talk of my own! It was less than five minutes long and gave an 
overview of my project. It was not filmed, but you can check out the (very 
sparse) slides [here](files/gsoc-slides.pdf). Those in attendance claimed I was 
"calm and competent." I'm not sure I would agree on either account but I don't 
have video evidence to refute the claim with :)


# Development #

The last two weeks should have seen the delivery of more workable edit 
capability. But due to delays with the editing application we chose to use, 
`django-inplaceedit`, things haven't been moving quite as quickly or smoothly 
as we'd desire. CSS bugs abound and not every editing task has been as easy as 
we'd like.

## `gsoc14.8` deliverables ##

The intended deliverables for this week were as follows, still following this 
[tracking item](http://openhatch.org/bugs/issue995):

+ Make remaining fields editable on the bug set view.
+ Tweak `django-inplaceedit` CSS to look better.

But work for this week was pushed back due to the Canada Day and July 4th long 
weekends and troubles with the CSS fixes, which were assumed to be much more 
straightforward than they turned out to be. It seems that CSS is 
&ast;complicated&ast;. Not to leave an impression that I didn't accomplish 
anything this week, here is a [code sample](https://github.com/ehashman/oh-mainline/commit/6ddd05f76e539badd3544f6f382e79de971502fe), 
not committed until the following week due to delays on content. I also have 
attached lots of fun screenshots!

## `gsoc14.9` deliverables ##

Initially, this milestone had a single deliverable of "Create/Edit Bug Set 
Screen."

However, at this point, the milestone requires a rescope most likely, as the 
work from `gsoc14.8` is still not quite complete. It's incredibly frustrating, 
but at least we left time to work out the kinks.

## What's next ##

At this point, it is effectively a list:

+ Scope out the next 4 weeks
+ Prepare for the [training missions sprint](http://lists.openhatch.org/pipermail/devel/2014-July/003656.html) on Tuesday
+ Get create/edit screen back on track

# Obstacles #

CSS has been the bane of my existence, the scourge of my livelihood, the pox on 
my $redacted for the last two weeks. I have never before been stuck with the 
challenge of integrating two disjoint web applications with slightly broken CSS 
that might look pretty on its own independently in each case but clash like red 
and green when brought together. I am not exaggerating when I say this was the 
worst experience I have had with programming in my entire brief career. (At 
least I now have further assurance that I have no desire to become a web 
developer...)

Asheesh has been great with helping me out, but we're still a bit delayed. He 
sent me a fun [CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/) tutorial which helped 
along my progress with selectors quite a bit. Part of the difficulty is 
determining what is "good enough" for the end product, as the OpenHatch team 
involves many experienced designers and web developers that might be able to 
accomplish easily what I am struggling with so much. There is also a commitment 
to a minimal viable product, but we must balance this with usability&mdash;a 
minimum requirement for release. So it makes it difficult deciding exactly how 
great this needs to be before we can move on.

School and time management continue to haunt me reliably like the little demons 
they are, but until someone actually implements `sudo service schoold stop`, I 
don't think there's much to be done in the meantime. It is a reality that must 
be faced.
