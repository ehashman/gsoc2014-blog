Summary: Project reqs and storyboarding complete.

What better way to bond with your community than hold a sprint and earn commit 
access?

# Sprinting #

On May 11, I led a sprint in Waterloo, Ontario in conjunction with the San 
Francisco OpenHatchers. The intent was to help people here get involved in the 
community, and to give myself an idea of what kinds of requirements I might 
need for the tool I'm building.

In addition to consuming many sandwiches and much ramen, we opened 7 issues, 
resolved 4, made 6 pull requests (4 of which have been merged), and I closed my 
first 3 pull requests as an official OpenHatch contributor. Not bad for a group 
of 8 students that had never contributed to open source software before!

This gave me valuable data as to what I as an event organizer might need in a 
bug set tool. Asheesh helped pick out a number of bugs in advance for the 
event, shared in a MoPad. This was easily accessible by all attendees, but 
could be accidentally cleared and was not a particularly rich source of 
information. Things that would have been useful include a place for attendees 
to mark the bug as "claimed" or assigned, skills required for completing the 
bug, an estimated work effort time, the area of the project the bug addressed 
(frontend, backend, web), etc.

# Project Design #

Already, Asheesh and I have pivoted on our original ideas. Initially we were 
thinking of something more search-focused to aid organizers in finding bugs, 
but we are now more convinced that tracker "advanced search" functionality is 
sufficient. Rather, we want to focus on importing these bugs into our list and 
adding annotation.

I've consulted with Shauna and am sending out additional emails with request 
for comment to other possibly interested users. I've summarized the initial 
iteration's design, along with Shauna's feedback [on the 
wiki](https://openhatch.org/wiki/GSoC_2014/bug-set-creator). This includes 
carefully hand-sketched mockups of a number of different screens in the work 
flow. Next week I think we will be ready to begin implementation, starting with 
the new data models for the tables we'll use to hold annotated bugs and bug 
lists. As Django has the ORM magic that I'm unfamiliar with, I'll be reading up 
on that this weekend to prepare for code next week. I might also look into 
writing test cases/user scenarios.
