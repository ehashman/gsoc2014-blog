Summary: Three weeks of updates, in time for the midterm review.

It's been three weeks since my last update. A lot has happened since! For those 
readers following my blog for interest's sake (and not as part of your 
administrative duties), you can expect another update in two weeks. Hopefully 
you don't feel too left out of the loop.

However, I've got plenty of exciting news to make up for the gap in 
communications. We've gone from tutorials and user consultation to a 
nearly-complete first iteration of the application, already [deployed to the 
main OpenHatch site](http://openhatch.org/bugsets). Now, you may notice the 
site link leads to an effectively blank page. As we currently don't have any 
production data, I've included some screenshots to give you a preview of the 
site in action!

# Pair programming #

Over the past few weeks, Asheesh and I have engaged in regular pair 
programming. After our first successful experiment with the [Django for 
Designers tutorial](http://openhatch.org/wiki/Django_for_Designers), we moved 
onto site-building efforts. As this is my first time working on an MVC web 
project, there's been lots to learn and being able to have my questions 
answered instantly has made the process so much smoother.  While I learned to 
value a powerful IDE during my last stint as a real Software Development 
Engineer&#8482; for the effective 50% productivity boost, I get the impression 
that "pear programming" has given me another 200%. While not 10x, I guess 3x 
isn't too shabby. Fruitful.

We've been using Google Hangouts for voice/video chat and VNC for 
screensharing. We set up a series of [deadlines for 
deliverables](http://openhatch.org/wiki/GSoC_2014/bug-set-creator#Project_Milestones) 
and tracking items for each one. Here is a weekly play-by-play of development 
thus far.

## `gsoc14.4` deliverables ##

+ Foundation for the site and initial bug set models. 
+ View all the bug sets in a list. 

Here's this week's [tracking item](http://openhatch.org/bugs/issue994) and a 
[code 
sample](https://github.com/ehashman/oh-mainline/commit/3276d2fbe438e4adb0877c2c460f0989702fbad0).

  <img alt="It appears two of these events have the same name" 
       src="images/setlist.png" />
  <br />

</div>

## `gsoc14.5` deliverables ##

+ Annotated bug models for within each set. 
+ Many-to-many model with the bug sets. 
+ Bug set view.

Here's this week's [tracking item](http://openhatch.org/bugs/issue995) and a 
[code 
sample](https://github.com/ehashman/oh-mainline/commit/1516da795d6b8cae10c72e58670f7888a0d1f16c).

       src="images/bugset1.png" />

</div>

## `gsoc14.6` deliverables ##

+ The initial iteration of inline-editable fields.

Here's a [code 
sample](https://github.com/ehashman/oh-mainline/commit/b37cd802ee1db53f60c1f71da3cd1a71f8f676ff) 
for this week.

## What's next ##

I will be focusing on my community involvement for the next week (`gsoc14.7`); 
in particular, I will be attending [Open Source 
Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org/) with (most of!) the rest of the OpenHatch 
gang. Beyond that, we have moved some deadlines around a bit.  `gsoc14.8` will 
see the refinement of the inplace editing introduced in `gsoc14.6`, and 
`gsoc14.9` will finally provide the web interface for building a bug set for an 
event.

# Community involvement #

A significant portion of my contributions in the past three weeks have been 
dedicated towards the OpenHatch community at large. In particular, I have been 
performing maintenance duties on 
[`oh-mainline`](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/). The majority of 
OpenHatch contributions are made to `oh-mainline`, so there are always a number 
of pull requests to review.

Given my familiarity with the codebase, I am reasonably qualified to review and 
merge code, and have been doing so whenever I can. Since the begining of the 
summer, I have merged nearly a dozen pull requests on both 
[`oh-mainline`](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/commits?author=ehashman) 
and 
[`oh-bugimporters`](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-bugimporters/commits?author=ehashman). 
The most satisfying to merge are obviously PRs that resulted from the [May 11 
sprint](project-reqs-and-storyboarding.html) :)

Of course, this has led me to become more familiar with the team of OpenHatch 
contributors and the community at large. I think this has been one of the most 
important parts of my GSoC experience thus far, and so I'm really pleased that 
next week's activities are exclusively to these ends!

## Open Source Bridge ##

One of the most exciting parts of receiving Google Summer of Code funding is 
that I have the chance to fly to really distant cities for project-related 
opportunities without dipping into my modest student budget. Asheesh and I 
discussed a few options for the summer, including a trip to San Francisco 
(similar to the hackathon week UCOSP holds), but in the end we decided on 
attending [Open Source Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org/). It seemed like 
the obvious choice: for one, I had intended to visit Portland while I was 
working in Seattle over the winter, but never had a free weekend. And of 
course, as I've stepped up my community involvement significantly over the 
course of the summer, being able to mix with a huge community of open source 
aficionados has a certain appeal and obvious value.

Open Source Bridge will take place in Portland, Oregon from June 24&ndash;27. I 
will be attending as an affiliate of the OpenHatch organization. Further 
updates sure to come with the next blog post. I'm incredibly excited: this is 
the first time I will represent OpenHatch in any official capacity. A year ago 
I could have never foreseen myself representing an open source project in any 
official capacity, so this is a really significant next step.

# Obstacles #

For the last few weeks, time management has remained my largest obstacle. 
Fundamental to any undergrad degree are procrastination, cramming, and weekly 
crises when the assignment deadline rolls around. I was able to keep a pretty 
good handle on things until this week (`gsoc14.6`) when two midterms and an 
assignment due date coincided.  Unsuprisingly, panic ensued. As a result, we 
decided to move the deliverable deadlines a little bit. As midterm season is 
now over, the largest hurdles should have been jumped. 

Good planning means that these deadline push backs won't be a problem though. 
We anticipated delays in deliverables, so we are definitely on schedule to ship 
a polished app for the end of the summer. I just wish it was going faster. :(

Asheesh may have given the most eloquent advice on the matter: "Be 
disappointed! Be a little disappointed... and then get over it."
