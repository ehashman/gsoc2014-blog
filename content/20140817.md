Summary: Last post and Google Summer of Code wrap-up.

Why not end the semester the same way we started it? Today we had another 
regular 
[OpenHatch sprint](http://lists.openhatch.org/pipermail/devel/2014-August/003719.html)!

# End of Term Sprint #

At today's sprint, we cleaned up a number of loose ends: all of my outstanding 
pull requests were merged and I polished up our deliverables in order to "put a 
bow on" our final product. I completed the usual chores of <a 
href="https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/1362" 
title="failboats">reviewing</a> and 
[merging](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/1365) others' pull 
requests. 

I also had the pleasure of mentoring a new friend and colleague, Kristina 
Foster, who I met at a Women Who Code meetup! Kristina is generally awesome, 
and works as a designer for a local company. We spent some time getting her 
Windows laptop set up with the `oh-mainline` code, learned a bit of git, and 
by the end of the day, I helped walk her through making her 
[first contribution](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/1368)
to an open source project! I'm so happy that I was able to help her achieve 
this. She did so well!

# Development #

As we reached the end of the development period, Asheesh and I worked on the 
most advanced features of the project and wrapped up our final deliverables. I 
think I speak for both of us when I say I am very pleased with the final 
product! 

You can try it out any time at the 
[OpenHatch website](https://openhatch.org/bugsets/)&mdash;it's been deployed to 
production. You'll need an OpenHatch account to create a bug set, but anyone 
can view them.

## `gsoc14.13` and `gsoc14.14` deliverables ##

I worked on a number of different features for these two weeks. I finished up 
the <a href="https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/1352" title="much goodness">create and edit screens</a>, 
[upgraded my code](https://github.com/ehashman/oh-mainline/commit/ed0c1a4eb4fe203da9da2e0c39afae63afc6d517) 
to be compatible with django 1.5, and 
[fixed the `django-inplaceedit` permissions](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/1346)

that now allow any public user to modify `AnnotatedBug` objects, while denying 
access to the rest of the database. I also paywalled the create and edit 
screens, and added a creation process for `AnnotatedBugs` through django forms, 
which resulted in a bit of an accidental reinvention of the `ModelForm` wheel, 
and also allowed for integration with our main database, which makes the 
process "smart."

Our issues were migrated to GitHub during this time, so they all received new 
numbers.

+ Create and edit screen issue: 
[\#1318](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/issues/1318) (formerly 1003), 
[code sample](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/309/files)
+ Django 1.5 code upgrade: 
[\#1345](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/issues/1345) (formerly 1030), 
[code 
sample](https://github.com/ehashman/oh-mainline/commit/ed0c1a4eb4fe203da9da2e0c39afae63afc6d517)
+ Fix public `inplaceedit` permissions: 
[\#1335](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/issues/1335) (formerly 1020), 
[code sample](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/1346/files)

## `gsoc14.15` deliverables ##

I spent this milestone working on the most advanced feature of the project: 
real-time updates for the list view screen. This involved <a 
href="https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/1359/files#diff-0de2f82c92738619a3d78b5e427bef9bR1" 
title="JavaSkripte&#8482;, the flexible but decidedly unsophisticated programming language popular with Web browsers in the late 1990s">writing some javascript</a>
that asynchronously updated all the editable fields on the page, such that if 
another user edits, the current user will be able to view their edit in near 
real-time. Thus, a number of users all viewing the same bugset will be able to 
concurrently view and edit it without confusion.

I also updated the main view with edit links when logged in, and a notice to 
log in order to create and edit sets when not logged in.

+ Asynchronous page updates: 
[\#1336](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/issues/1336) (formerly 1021), 
<a href="https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/1359/files" 
title="such +1">code sample</a>
+ Update main view with contextual information: 
[\#1360](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/issues/1360), [code 
sample](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/1361/files)

# Obstacles #

Over the last blog post period, I've encountered new and exciting obstacles to 
conquer. The primary issues have been the django upgrade, final exams, and the 
GitHub issue migration.

Some time in the past month, we decided to upgrade django out of the stone 
ages, and thus, the django 1.5 migration was born. However, this broke a 
[number of my tests](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/issues/1345) 
and dependencies, and 
[generally confused me](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/issues/1322). 
But with the support of my mentor, and a 
[`south` upgrade](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/312), 
we were able to smoothly sail through these treacherous waters.

I also had final exams over the past week, which was the usual stressful fiasco 
that is. My marks come out tonight. I can't say I'm anticipating them with 
great joy. Of course, my **CS 499R** mark is great :)

The last obstacle was the GitHub issues migration. I had [some 
objections](http://lists.openhatch.org/pipermail/devel/2014-August/003721.html)
to the migration, both functional and ideological, but I don't have a better 
solution so I've accepted this outcome. I had a difficult time finding my new, 
renumbered issues and reassigning them, navigating the (imho) overly minimal 
tracker model, and generally getting used to the new system. 

In the end, all was overcome. The project must go on. And so it has.

# Extending the project #

As this is my final blog post, I wanted to document the outstanding issues with 
my newly developed application, as well as some areas for future extension. It 
is likely that I will have a chance to work on these things in the near future, 
though they are not in the scope of my Google Summer of Code project.

## Remaining issues ##

+ Code clean-up, addressing feedback in 
[this review](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/1359/)
+ Migration to django `ModelForm`s away from our 
[home-baked implementation](https://github.com/ehashman/oh-mainline/blob/71e84fdf67756c2cf34f3184524144ae069c57da/mysite/bugsets/forms.py#L59)
+ [Real-time removal of bugs](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/1359/files#r16331106)
that have been removed from the bug set via the edit interface

## Future extensions/to-dos ##

+ Filtering by status (unclaimed, claims, needs-review, resolved)
+ We currently pull some metadata from the main OpenHatch bug database to 
create `AnnotatedBug` objects. It would be nice to be able to refresh this 
metadata, perhaps by clicking a button.
+ Field testing
+ User guide and additional documentation
