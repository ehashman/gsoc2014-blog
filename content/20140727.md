Summary: Writing tests to pwn the database, writing forms for great justice.

"Hey&mdash;I have this crazy idea. What if the POSTs `django-inplaceedit` 
processes are totally exploitable?"

# Security Hilarity #

And so our journey down the rabbit hole began. It turns out that you should 
probably never include little-used open source software that modifies entries 
in your database while making the assumption that it's secure.

I believe the following code speaks for itself:

```python
def test_will_inplaceedit_allow_us_to_pwn_ourselves(self):
    # Asheesh: "total cost of pwnership: 1 test"
    # note: user paulproteus has poor password hygiene
    u = User.objects.create(username='paulproteus', password='password')
    u.save()

    self.client.post(
        '/inplaceeditform/save/',
        {
            "app_label": "auth",      # the django app
            "module_name": "user",    # the django table
            "field_name": "username", # the field name
            "obj_id": u.pk,           # the pk
            "value": '"LOLPWNED"'     # new value
        })

    self.assertEqual(User.objects.get(pk=u.pk).username, "LOLPWNED")
```

Carefully crafting this payload involved very little effort; watching this test 
pass was a little bit horrifying.

The problem stems from the way `django-inplaceedit` sets up user permissions; 
their docs give an example of only allowing superusers edit access, which would 
suggest an internal or authenticated use case. But we want our bugsets to be 
publicly editable... and given that this is the way we set up our permissions, 
we also implicitly gave the entire public internet the ability to edit our 
entire database. Wow.

Lesson learned: trust no one. Or, at least restrict access to the `bugsets` app 
tables. For now, we've disabled this by turning off edit access in production. 
We also plan to make an upstream pull request to the `django-inplaceedit` docs 
to help others avoid this kind of security issue in the future. We also created 
([and addressed](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/307)) an 
[issue](https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue1020) to track this fun adventure.

# Development #

Development for this period started off a little delayed due to lack of Asheesh 
availability, and development on the main project was delayed slightly by the 
GIANT SECURITY HOLE `django-inplaceedit` introduced, but we sure wrote a lot of 
code in the end.

## `gsoc14.10` and `gsoc14.11` deliverables ##

These two weeks saw the end of the long-standing 
[issue995](http://openhatch.org/bugs/issue995):

+ Fix `django-inplaceedit` CSS to make the screen usable
+ YAGNI simplification of `AnnotatedBug` fields

This milestone was pushed back again due to difficulty with CSS and issues that 
continually arose every time existing ones were fixed. Here's a 
[code sample](https://github.com/ehashman/oh-mainline/commit/8a21e217efeb14a4799605fc48647b74524f040a)
that reflects the majority of these two weeks' development.

## `gsoc14.12` deliverables ##

This milestone saw [major development](https://github.com/ehashman/oh-mainline/compare/ehashman:ba63864...ec6869e) 
of the create/edit view 
([tracking issue](https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue1003)).

Asheesh and I fought with Django forms, many tests, and mostly emerged 
victorious.

## What's next ##

There are a number of features we've discussed implementing for the last few 
weeks. But here's what we have planned:

+ Finishing up the edit view
+ Update list view to include edit links (while logged in)
+ Simultaneous editing: async notification if loaded page values have changed
+ Security fixes to re-enable editing in production
+ Refresh button for associated metadata we have in the OpenHatch bug db
+ User testing
+ Documentation

# Obstacles #

There have been two main issues the past few weeks: CSS issues and 
availability. As I've lamented about CSS in my last post, I'll discuss the 
availability problem in a bit more detail.

Since returning from OSBridge, Asheesh and I have been a bit busy playing 
catchup with school and work. In particular, since Asheesh' availability has 
been even less than that of the dreaded "working adult with a life outside of 
job," we've had a lot less time to sync up and pair. And due to catching up on 
assignments and course wrapup, I was able to complete less GSoC work than I 
might have if Asheesh was babysitting me in some pairing sessions.

In regard to the CSS, in the end I managed to figure it out! A big thanks to 
Rachelle Saunders, who I met at a local Women Who Code meetup, and was able to 
solve all my woes in all of 5 fateful minutes. You rock, lady! (A moment of 
silence for all those hours I could have spent fighting with this on my own. 
Tears shed for the loss of this valuable learning experience.)
